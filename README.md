📦 SaaSPlatform (.NET 9)

A modern multi-tenant SaaS platform built with .NET 9, Clean Architecture, DDD, and CQRS (Phase 1).

This project is part of a structured journey toward Azure certifications (AZ-204, AZ-104, AZ-305) and real-world system design mastery.

🚀 Purpose of This Project

This is not a CRUD demo.

It is a real-world architecture simulation project designed to evolve like an enterprise system:

  Start with a clean monolith
  
  Apply DDD (Domain-Driven Design)
  
  Introduce CQRS
  
  Add unit testing
  
  Prepare for Azure cloud integration
  
  Evolve into microservices + event-driven architecture
  
---

🧱 Architecture (Phase 1)

SaaSPlatform.Api

        ↓
        
SaaSPlatform.Application

        ↓
SaaSPlatform.Domain

        ↓
SaaSPlatform.Infrastructure

        ↓
SQL Server (EF Core)

Clean Architecture Principles:

  Domain has zero dependencies
  
  Application contains use cases (CQRS)
  
  Infrastructure handles external concerns (DB, storage, etc.)
  
  API is only a delivery mechanism
  
---

🧠 Key Concepts Implemented (Phase 1)

✅ Domain-Driven Design (DDD)

  Entities
  
  Value Objects (planned)
  
  Domain-first modeling approach
  
✅ CQRS (Basic Implementation)

  Commands → Write operations
  
  Queries → Read operations
  
  Handlers per use case
  
✅ Clean Architecture

  Separation of concerns
  
  Dependency inversion
  
  Maintainable and scalable structure
  
✅ Unit Testing

  xUnit framework
  
  Domain-level tests
  
  Application handler tests

📦 Core Modules

🏢 Tenant Management

Foundation for multi-tenant SaaS architecture.

📦 Product Module

Tenant-based product management.

🧾 Order Module

Order creation and retrieval using CQRS pattern.

---

🧪 Testing Strategy

This project uses:

  xUnit → test framework
  
  FluentAssertions → readable assertions (recommended)
  
  Moq → mocking dependencies (Application layer)
  
  
Test Coverage:

  Domain logic validation
  
  CQRS command/query handlers
  
  Application layer behavior

🛠️ Tech Stack (.NET 9)

  .NET 9
  
  ASP.NET Core Web API
  
  Entity Framework Core
  
  SQL Server
  
  xUnit
  
  Clean Architecture
  
  CQRS (manual implementation in Phase 1)

📌 What This Project Will Become

This project evolves step-by-step into a full enterprise cloud platform:

🔜 Phase 2 — Azure Foundation (AZ-204 Start)

  Azure App Service deployment
  
  Azure SQL Database
  
  Azure Key Vault
  
  GitHub Actions CI/CD
  
🔜 Phase 3 — Performance & Messaging

  Redis caching
  
  Azure Service Bus
  
  Azure Functions (background jobs)
  
🔜 Phase 4 — Distributed Systems

  Microservices architecture
  
  Event-driven design (Kafka-style thinking)
  
  API Gateway (Azure APIM)
  
🔜 Phase 5 — Advanced Cloud Architecture

  Kubernetes (AKS)
  
  High availability design
  
  Scalability (10k+ RPS systems)
  
---

📎 Notes

This project is intentionally built as an evolving architecture system, not a static application.

Each phase introduces real-world complexity found in enterprise SaaS platforms.
